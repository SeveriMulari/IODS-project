# The data includes 382 observations and 35 variables. The data includes information on student achievement in secondary education in two Portuguese schools.There are 35 different variables such as school, sex, age, adress etc.

# Now lets study about relationships between high/low alcohol consumption and these four variables: (1) age, (2) sex, (3) guardian and (4) health. My hypothesis is that alcohol consumption increases with older age, male sex, father as a single parent and if health situation is poor.

# As you can see, the sensitivity of my model is 3.57% and the specifity of my model is 99.26%. So sensitivity isn't great... The model has extremely poor performance in predicting high alcohol use.
